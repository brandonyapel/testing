# Welcome to Unit Testing!

Using `mocha` and `chai` as we did in lecture, you're going to practice both writing tests and fixing code to match unit tests.


## Write Modules

Pick one of the whiteboard questions from last week (we would not recommend the Prime number one) and implement it in javascript inside a module. 

Write unit tests for this module. It's best practice to start with the tests but you can do it either way.


## Fix Code to Pass Tests

Run the tests for the OddEven module. Notice it isn't passing the tests. 

Change the CODE to pass the TESTS. Do not change the tests!
